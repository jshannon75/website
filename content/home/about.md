# Biography

I'm a geographer studying how to make urban neighborhoods and food systems healthier and more equitable. My broad interests are in urban development and inequality, geographic information systems, political geography, and place effects on health. More specifically, my research focuses on the role of maps and spatial analysis in shaping our understanding of hunger, housing, poverty, and neighborhood development and enabling community organization around these issues.

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Geography and the Department of Financial Planning, Housing, and Consumer Economics at the University of Georgia. I direct the Community Mapping Lab in the Department of Geography and am an assistant director of the Housing and Demographics Research Center on campus.

You can find more information on my specific research projects on my research page or browse publications. I welcome interest from graduate students interested in studying disparities in access to food and housing, participatory and engaged research, open source GIS tools, and community development.
